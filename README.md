# web-project-portfolio

Day 1:

- worked on mobile version first, getting layout of HTML tags
- started with basic styling of the first elements of the mobile page in scss
- have not added all elements for website —> will go back to that when doing the website layout
- am yet to add changes to formatting for responsiveness + accessibility —> fix pixels
- still need to add variables, change colours and fonts, fix excess whitespace and check the naming conventions
