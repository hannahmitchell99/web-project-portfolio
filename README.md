# web-project-portfolio

This web project was designed to present a portfolio of my various projects, while using my newfound skill of SCSS to hone my website to its most aesthetically pleasing self!

Beyond its original purpose, this project also served as a consolidation of my skills in CSS, SCSS, HTML and BEM naming conventions.

While I’ve had limited use of these in the past, it really only began to “click” for me as I finished week 1 of my _nology training and as I applied this throughout the project.

That being said, how I originally structured and planned the project became super important for me to be able to approach the task with confidence.

**Here were my priorities within the project:**

*As per the brief, I first prioritised:*

- Mobile-first design
- Accessibility
- Correct naming conventions and readability
- Semantic HTML elements

*Regarding my own journey with learning, I then prioritised:*

- Gaining a greater understanding of flexbox and grid, and using them as needed so that I felt more comfortable with them.
    - This included determining which elements would need to be displayed using them. I have a tendency to use grid, as you’ll soon see!
- Working first on elements in the mobile design, without adding any other elements yet that would only be applicable in the desktop version. These elements came later when I was comfortable with my mobile design.
    - This was important for me to be able to focus on what I was working on at the time.

**So before I began to tackle the code, this is what I did:**

I split all elements into their various groups according to the mobile design. I kept this as simple as possible, just so that I could know how to style their layout, first and foremost. Here’s a snippet of that planning process.

**When I started coding, this is how I approached it:**

- First, as I mentioned, I began with the mobile HTML elements and split them into sections to be styled.
- Then I added styling through SCSS. I first focused on layout, then on styling for individual elements.
- I then worked on the styling for the desktop version.
- I found some new fonts, found some cohesive colors that went into variables, and tried to make it look a little prettier.
- I then split up my SCSS code into partials to enhance readability.

*Special thanks to my coach, Rob Hooper, for guiding me in my layout teething problems.*
